Food Order
=============
A simple food ordering web application created as an assignment for PwC Digital Solutions. This application is simple to use for the consumer to order their favorite food online and makes it easy for the restaurant to add more dishes to the collection and to make it easy to manage their orders.

This application has two sides

* Food order: Customer facing. A User interface to allow the customer to choose a dish and add them to a cart first and then checkout as a batch later. The payment would be done at checkout.
	* This is a simple app, so payment is assured even without a credit card and is not considered to be a factor here.
* Food Management: Administrator facing. A simple user interface for the restaurant manager to add a dish to their menu and manage orders. This will also be a dashboard for the restaurant that shows foods that have been ordered and how many times.
	* Again, payment is not considered to be a factor here.
